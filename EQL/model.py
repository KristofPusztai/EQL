            dataset is exhausted. When passing an infinitely repeating dataset, you must specify the steps_per_epoch

            If 'validation_steps' is None, validation will run until the validation_data dataset is exhausted.
            In the case of an infinitely repeated dataset, it will run into an infinite loop. If 'validation_steps'

        Returns the loss value & metrics values for the model in test mode.

        Computation is done in batches (see the batch_size arg.)

        :param x:Input data. It could be:
            -A Numpy array (or array-like), or a list of arrays (in case the model has multiple inputs).
            -A TensorFlow tensor, or a list of tensors (in case the model has multiple inputs).
            -A dict mapping input names to the corresponding array/tensors, if the model has named inputs.
            -A tf.data dataset. Should return a tuple of either (inputs, targets) or (inputs, targets, sample_weights).
            -A generator or keras.utils.Sequence returning (inputs, targets) or (inputs, targets, sample_weights).
            -A more detailed description of unpacking behavior for iterator types (Dataset, generator, Sequence) is
            given in the Unpacking behavior for iterator-like inputs section of Model.fit.

        :param y: Target data. Like the input data x, it could be either Numpy array(s) or TensorFlow tensor(s).
            It should be consistent with x (you cannot have Numpy inputs and tensor targets, or inversely).
            If x is a dataset, generator or keras.utils.Sequence instance, y should not be specified (since targets
            will be obtained from the iterator/dataset).

            function. You can either pass a flat (1D) Numpy array with the same length as the input samples
            (1:1 mapping between weights and samples), or in the case of temporal data, you can pass a 2D array with
            shape (samples,sequence_length), to apply a different weight to every timestep of every sample.
            This argument is not supported when x is a dataset, instead pass sample weights as the third element of x.

            Ignored with the default value of None. If x is a tf.data dataset and steps is None, 'evaluate' will
            run until the dataset is exhausted. This argument is not supported with array inputs.

        :param workers: Used for generator or keras.utils.Sequence input only. Maximum number of processes to
            spin up when using process-based threading. If unspecified, workers will default to 1. If 0, will execute
            the generator on the main thread.
